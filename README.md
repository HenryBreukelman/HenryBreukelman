## About Me

My name is Henry Breukelman. I am currently taking software development at Manitoba Institute of 
Trades and Technology, and have learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I want to get 
into app design or making games. 

I enjoy designing and crating things whether it is with Lego, Minecraft or code. I live in 
Roseisle Manitoba which is about an hour from Winnipeg.
