## About Me

My name is Henry Breukelman. I am currently taking software development at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology, and 
have learned the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I want to get into app design or making games. 

I enjoy designing and crating things whether it is with Lego, Minecraft or code. I live in Roseisle Manitoba which is about
an hour from Winnipeg.
